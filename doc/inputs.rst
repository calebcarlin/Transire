Input
===========

Command Line
____________

The program is invoked on the command line:

python -m transire.py -i example.in -o output.out

  or

transire.py -i example.in -o output.out

-i  path to file with input keywords (required).

-o  name of output file (optional).  Can be specified in the input file.

Input File
__________

The input file is a plain text document comprised of keywords and values separated by an '='.
Lines without keywords or that start with '#' are ignored.
The input file is specified using the '-i' flag on the command line.

**Formatting:**

The ideal formatting for a keyword line is:

keyword = value

with a space on either side of the '=' and nothing after the value.  However, the spaces are not
generally necessary but may result in an error if omitted.

Keywords with the (array) mark in the description are given as several integers separated by spaces
such as:

keyword = 1 0 0
